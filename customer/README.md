Mock customer app which:
- provides signup and login for access;
- stores user, item, order and sale entities;
- communicates with the vehicle-API that provides the car list, then converts it to a presented item list;
- mocks adding to cart (add new or increase quantity) and payment (creates sale with status processed).
